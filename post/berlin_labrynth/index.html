      <p>We started the day moving apartments from our first Berlin AirBnB stay to our
second Berlin AirBnB stay (booked after mass confusion and panic), which was
fortunately only a block down the street. After dropping off our stuff at the
new place, we quickly left for our tour of Sachsenhausen, the closest
concentration camp to Berlin. Our tourguide was a very tall, skinny, and pale
Brit named Rob, who was very quick-witted and clearly experienced at giving
tours. We met up with our group of about 15, took a train for 40 minutes, a bus
for another 5, and then finally began our tour at Sachsenhausen around 12.</p>

<p>Much like the tour of Yad Vashem, witnessing the horrors of Sachsenhausen
eventually gave way to an enveloping sense of numbness. One of the first major
topics we covered was the SS and their methods for keeping the camp under
control with only ~300 officers for ~50,000 prisoners. They obviously had
fences, guns, and machine gun turrets surrounding and overlooking the entirety
of the camp, but this wasn&rsquo;t enough. To really control the prisoners, they
employed an ingenious and cruel system of hierarchy and intimidation, primarily
designed to break the prisoners spirits and turn them against each other. When
a group of prisoners arrived to Sachsenhausen, the SS would pick one prisoner
that stood out from the rest and beat him to near death infront of the rest of
the group. The prisoners would then be sorted into a rigid hierarchy, with
criminals occupying the highest position, jews occupying the lowest, and
blacks/roma/other undesirables occupying everything in between. This helped to
turn the prisoners against themselves, further helping prevent an uprising.
Over and over throughout the tour, I found myself involuntarily muttering
expletives. The sheer cruelty and evil that they institutionalized is beyond
description.  Learning about all the gritty details of how they carried out
this evil really drove home how horrible they were. To carry out everything
that SS soldiers did required a special combination of brainwashing (to see
others as subhuman), cruelty, evil, and blind unquestioning obedience to
authority.</p>

<p>The worst part of Sachsenhausen was the area specifically reserved for
mass murdering. They only employed gas chambers and shooting people into pits
on a minor scale. The main method with which they murdered over 10,000 russian
prisoners of war and other undesirables at Sachsenhausen was called the
&ldquo;neckshot&rdquo; method. This was where they had incoming prisoners go into a
&ldquo;medical examination&rdquo; room one at a time, stand behind a height-measuring
device with a slit down the middle, and then the executioner would shoot the
person in the neck from the other side of the slit. This solved a major
problem, which was the psychological toll that having to execute someone
face-to-face was taking on SS officers. Once the prisoner was executed, his
body would then be incinerated. During the war, the only visible sign of
industrial murder outside of the death-building was the copious amount of smoke
produced by constant cremation.</p>

<p>We finished up the tour, walked back to the train station, and bid Rob
adieu. After we got back to our new place, we grabbed dinner across the street
at a little cafe recommended by Grace. It didn&rsquo;t disappoint, although we
unfortunately left ourselves a small amount of time to experience &ldquo;the
labyrinth&rdquo;. Recommended by our friend Adrienne, &ldquo;the labyrinth&rdquo; refers to
Salonâ€“Zur wilden Renate, a small bar/club in Berlin that houses a crawling maze
in the back. I insisted on going as our last activity in Berlin - I trusted
Adrienne&rsquo;s wisdom and didn&rsquo;t want to miss out. We rushed on public transit and
got there exactly at 10, which is when they stop accepting people in the maze.
Out of sheer luck, the hostess included us as the last 2 people in the night&rsquo;s
queue of labyrinth-goers.</p>

<p>The door lady said it would be two hours before we
could go in, giving us plenty of time for a few drinks. We bought a couple of
cheap and strong mixed drinks and grabbed seats in the little venue-area to
watch this weird electro-punk band that was playing. I was instantly convinced
that this was the weirdest show of my life. The band, Sado Opera, was made up
of a DJ-keyboardist duo in the back, a drummer on an electric drum set, a
skinny lead singer, two backup lady singers, and a dwarf. They warmed up by
playing the two same songs over and over again to check levels and coordinate
the light show. The first song was a catchy song about &lsquo;fire at the disco&rsquo;, or
something like that. The second song was an equally catchy song that is
described well by its line: &lsquo;I dream of love but I make fuck with
every-every-everybody&rsquo;. The chorus consisted of the 2 lady backup singers
yelling &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sad - I&rsquo;m so lonely - Just a squirt - Make me squirt&rdquo; in a
hilariously German voice. They also spent a little time coordinating the lights
for a special part of their show. The lead singer instructed the light tech to
flicker the lights when he (the lead singer) did the following actions: yelling
&ldquo;THERE IS HIGH VOLTAGE&rdquo;, writhing around on stage, and pretending to clamp
alligator clips on the (topless) backup singers&rsquo; nipples. Throughout their
warm-up set, Hannah and I were cracking up. I couldn&rsquo;t believe how weirdly
awesome and awesomely weird this band was, and that we were getting to
experience it all! Regrettably, the band was actually playing their real set at
3:30am, and considering we had an 8:45am train to catch, this was a bit out of
the question. On our way out, we got to meet them and they enthusiastically
handed us their card and told us to like them on facebook.</p>

<p>Midnight came around quickly (time flies when you&rsquo;re having fun) and
shortly thereafter came our turn for the Labyrinth. Hannah went in first, and
they led me in a few minutes after. The lady put a blindfold over my eyes and
led me by hand into the start of Labyrinth, where she took the blindfold off
and closed the door. The Labyrinth itself was basically a big adult
playstructure with tunnels and enclosed spaces and weird artwork all over the
walls. There was a room with a bunch of monstrous vaginas painted on the wall
whose exit itself was a big vagina, and there was a room/tunnel containing a
bunch of interesting artwork made out of old metal car parts and stuff. I was
running through like a kid in a candy shop, trying to take it all in and
capture the most exciting parts on my phone&rsquo;s camera. I had a bit of a buzz
before entering, but I was riding a purely natural high of excitement all
throughout the maze. It was the best thing I could&rsquo;ve hoped for to end our trip
to Berlin.</p>

      <title>Regular Route on Fairview Dome</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My day began on a bright and sunny morning in Tuolumne meadows without a
partner. I had prevoiusly arranged to spend the day climbing with a user on
mountain project, but when I met him he was on his way out to do laundry in Lee
Vining. This was undesirable yet understandable, given he was living and
climbing in the meadows for 2 months. Upon hearing this, I started scanning the
Tuolumne Meadows general store parking lot for other potential partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After about a half hour sitting in the back of my van reading a book with my
climbing gear visible, I spied a potential candidate. Approach shoes? Check.
Nice bed in the back of his car? Check. Build of a climber? Check. He also had
a settlers of catan bumper sticker, an unambiguous sign of good taste. His name
was Jack, and to no one&amp;rsquo;s surprise, he was also up in the meadows on a climbing
trip. He couldn&amp;rsquo;t find his friends he was supposed to do Matthes Crest with, so
we didn&amp;rsquo;t waste any time taking off to go climb somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our first objective was West Crack on Daff dome, which is a classic 5.8 route that
ascends a splitter crack up the side of the dome over 4 pitches. After the
first pitch it was clear Jack was a great partner. We worked very well
together, climbed around the same level (Jack was clearly the superior
climber), and were both stoked to climb all day. We made quick work of West
Crack, and afterwards wanted something a little more substantial. Staring us in
the face was Fairview dome, and what better route to attempt than the most
famous one leading directly up its prow? When I mentioned that the regular
route was in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifty_Classic_Climbs_of_North_America&#34;&gt;famous list of 50 classic
climbs&lt;/a&gt;,
Jack got especially psyched to give it a go. It was 1pm, there were no clouds
in the sky, no chance of thunderstorms, and we were ready to send.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got to the base of the climb around 2 or so. I took the first pitch, which
is the crux of the whole climb. It started with 75 feet of easy climbing, then
as the dome curved up it got steadily harder, until the crux about 150 feet up
which is a slippery 5.9 fingercrack in a corner. I put in a prolific amount of
pro and managed to make it clean to the belay. We had a 70 meter rope, which
allowed me to make it to a spacious ledge with a tree to anchor to. I highly
recommend getting to this ledge any way possible to end the first
pitch, even if you have to simulclimb on a 60 meter. All of the other belay
spots below are marginal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.marrama.com/images/small_IMG_4792.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Looking down on the first pitch. The crux was right below the bright part of
the crack&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We swung leads the whole climb, so Jack took pitch 2 while I enjoyed the
view. The majority of pitch 2 was an awesome flaring hand crack. It was rated
5.8, but it was surprisingly sustained. I was starting to get a little
fatigued, but the climbing was just moderate enough and too damn fun to get
tired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.marrama.com/images/small_IMG_4790.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Looking up pitch 2. The rope disappears up the corner and the pitch eventually
makes its way to a ledge on the left&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third pitch wasn&amp;rsquo;t as obvious as the first two. I ended up meandering up a
system of cracks and knobby faces to crescent ledge, a large ledged shaped like
(you guessed it!) a crescent. Despite this pitch being a &amp;ldquo;choose your own
adventure to crescent ledge&amp;rdquo; style climb, it still was quite good. Jack did a
little variation up a crack in a roof that he was quite psyched on. It should
be noted that we ended up doing 4 guidebook pitches in 3 actual pitches with a
70 meter. They were easy to link.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.marrama.com/images/small_IMG_4795.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Looking down on the very end of pitch 3 from the start of crescent ledge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.marrama.com/images/small_IMG_4797.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Great spot to eat an energy bar or 3!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We took a little break to devour some clif bars and let our toes rest from
hours of climbing, then started up pitch 4. This pitch was easy to forget,
mainly because it was about 120 feet of easy climbing up crescent ledge. My
feet weren&amp;rsquo;t happy to be back in climbing shoes, either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.marrama.com/images/small_IMG_4798.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Crescent ledge really is a crescent. P4 goes right up the ledge/corner&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took pitch 5, which was a link-up of pitch 6 and 7 in the guidebook. The
first half of the pitch was awesome climbing. I went up a corner into a crack
system that goes straight up a roof with an old piton. The rest of the pitch
wandered up a ledge system. I eventually set a belay at the top of a smaller
ledge close to easier terrain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.marrama.com/images/small_IMG_4826.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The view from the P6 belay, looking down on the second half of the pitch. Jack
is undoubtedly wondering how I managed to get so horrible at rope management.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jack lead one more easy pitch that traversed back right to the bottom of a big
stretch of 3rd and 4th class terrain. At this point the guidebook showed 5 more
pitches of extremely easy climbing with occasional 5.5 sections, so we decided
to simul-climb the rest of it. We folded the rope in half, I took all the gear,
and I set off with Jack belaying and eventually following. We made it to the
summit about 30 minutes later after walking up the majority of the last
stretch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.marrama.com/images/small_IMG_4810.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Looking down on the ledges we simul-climbed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We summitted around 6:50, just in time to savor the incredible view
all around us. We walked off in the dusk and made it back to the cars around
7:50. We were both exhausted yet giddy that a non-day of climbing turned into a
worthy epic, ascending over 1600 feet and one of the best routes around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.marrama.com/images/small_IMG_4807.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Looking east towards the meadows. The picture doesn&amp;rsquo;t really do it justice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The East Buttress of Middle Cathedral</title>
      <link>http://blog.marrama.com/post/east_butt_middle_cathedral/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 05 Jun 2016 11:59:00 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://blog.marrama.com/post/east_butt_middle_cathedral/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;After being introduced to climbing in the valley about a year ago, I&amp;rsquo;ve been
constantly building and refining an ordered list of Classic Climbs that I Must
Do. The east buttress of middle cathedral occupied a special spot on The List,
because it seemed like it would be both a way to push my boundaries and a
shitload of fun. According to everything I had read beforehand, the route
offered continuous 5.8 to 5.10c climbing over 11 pitches of perfect granite. I
can barely lead 5.9 trad climbs and I&amp;rsquo;ve never done more than 5 pitches of 5.8,
so this route seemed like the next logical step up. The route offers lots of
possibilities to aid through the cruxes and to bail if needed, so why not?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The opportunity came last week when I was in the valley with my buddy Gavin.
Gavin climbs at about the same level and has the same amount of stoke (very
high), so we went for it on a sunny day. We got to the pullout and finished
racking up at around 8:30, and thanks to a well marked climber&amp;rsquo;s trail we
got to the base of the climb around 9.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We swung leads the whole time, and I took the first lead linking up pitch 1 and
2. Pitch 1 was about 100 feet of reasonably easy climbing, but it quickly heats
up at the start of P2 with a 5.8 roof. The roof was a little tricky and took me some
extra time to figure out, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t too bad once I found a hidden jug. The
rest of the climbing to the top of P2 was fairly easy. The rope drag at the top
of P2 was &lt;em&gt;horrendous&lt;/em&gt;; I should&amp;rsquo;ve used longer slings at the roof.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.marrama.com/images/IMG_4306.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;View from the top of P2. Not bad!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.marrama.com/images/IMG_4308.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Gavin getting psyched to link P3 and P4&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gavin took the next lead, which was a linkup of pitches 3 and 4. Our 60 meter
rope was just long enough to link the 2 pitches. These pitches were fantastic.
The start to P3 was a somewhat stiff 5.8 fingercrack wedged into a corner, and
the rest of the 2 pitches were super fun laybacks. The climbing was very
interesting and confidence inspiring, especially on toprope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.marrama.com/images/GOPR0023.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The start of P3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.marrama.com/images/GOPR0030.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Looking down on the end of P4&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.marrama.com/images/GOPR0027.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Stoke level: still high&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.marrama.com/images/IMG_4310.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;El Cap was staring at us the whole climb. Tempting!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next pitch was the crux pitch, and it fell on me. There are 2 options for
pitch 5: the original route, which starts with a bolt ladder that can go free
at 5.10c and then continues to a 5.9 roof, or a 5.10a face climb that continues
to a small roof and easier face climb. After debating with myself outloud, I
eventually said &lt;em&gt;fuck it&lt;/em&gt; and went for the 10a face climb option. I figured it
would be an even larger accomplishment to do the whole route free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The free variation was actually quite fun. The face climb leading up to the
roof was easier than expected, and the roof took a little bit of thought but it
wasn&amp;rsquo;t horrible. After the first bolt (which is easy to get to), the crux is
relatively easy to protect. The face climb after the roof is an incredibly fun 5.6
filled with big juggy slopers. The face gave way to a fun little layback
section, which ends the pitch at a ledge with a set of bolts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.marrama.com/images/IMG_4309.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The start of P5 - very fun knobby traverse&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at the topo, I thought that it would be straightforward to link pitches
5 and 6 with a 60 meter rope. When I got to the anchor at the top of P5, I
decided to go for it even though the rope drag was already kind of bad. The
first half of P6 is a face climb requiring lots of balance; the rope drag
didn&amp;rsquo;t help with that. The second half was a layback up to another ledge. I
just made it onto the ledge when I heard Gavin yell out &amp;ldquo;Joe, you have 5
feet!&amp;ldquo;, and unfortunately the chains were 15 feet over to the right on the
ledge. After some back and forth, we decided to simul-climb to the P6 anchor.
Fortunately, Gavin only had to do a short easy traverse to the first bolt of P5
to give me enough slack to get to the anchors. I anchored in with a great sigh
of relief, put Gavin on belay, and ate a sandwich.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.marrama.com/images/GOPR0036.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The P6 chains! Yes! I have to work on keeping my anchors neater&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.marrama.com/images/GOPR0038.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The ledge leading up to the chains. I ran it out to preserve rope and not
contribute to drag. Also it was easy :)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gavin led the next pitch (P7), which consisted of more fun layback cracks in
left-facing corners. We both made quick work of it. I took pitch 8, which was
one of the most memorable of the whole climb. The pitch started with a short
blocky section narrowing down to a wide handcrack in the back of a big flared
groove. The end of the pitch was yet another fun layback to short face
traverse. The climbing was very heady and thought-provoking; it was easy to
climb poorly with haste, but the climbing was easy when done right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.marrama.com/images/IMG_4311.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The start of P7&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.marrama.com/images/IMG_4322.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Looking down at the end of P7&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.marrama.com/images/IMG_4326.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Gavin following up the end of P8&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, fatigue was beginning to set in. We had started at a
less-than-ideal time when the route was beginning to get sun, and we had baked
in direct sunlight for the whole time. It was around 1:30 when we both got to
the top of P8 and only then were we escaping the sun. We took a little break to
recuperate and hydrate, then Gavin set off on P9.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.marrama.com/images/IMG_4333.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Looking up at P9 which goes around to the left of the bushes. Almost out of
the sun!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pitch 9 was a less memorable pitch. It followed a small crack up more left
facing corners. Pitch 10 was my last lead. The pitch started with a
surprisingly hard finger crack that was marked 5.6 on the topo, then continued
up a narrow crack system into a section of 5.8 finger crack that goes into a
gully. I was moving exceedingly slow on this bit, making sure I was using the
least amount of energy possible without getting too careless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.marrama.com/images/GOPR0059.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Gavin cruising up P10. I probably should have gone up the crack directly under
me, it looked like better climbing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last pitch, pitch 11, was Gavin&amp;rsquo;s lead. The first half was a large flaring
5.7 chimney followed by some easier 4th class. The chimney was quite unwelcome
to both of us; we both had packs on and aren&amp;rsquo;t fans of chimnies. Gavin grunted
his way up, I followed in the same fashion, and we promptly collapsed at the
top-out and devoured the rest of our food and water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.marrama.com/images/IMG_4335.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Gavin mustering up all remaining energy to lead the chimney behind him&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.marrama.com/images/GOPR0068.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;We done did it! The topout wasn&amp;rsquo;t glorious but it was more than welcome&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The descent was a little more than we bargained for. We followed the beta in
the guidebook for the Kat Walk to the best of our abilities, but we ended up
following a pseudo-trail to a series of 5 rappels with our single 60m
rope. According to &lt;a href=&#34;http://web.stanford.edu/~clint/yos/katpen.htm&#34;&gt;this topo&lt;/a&gt;,
we went down the penny pinnacle rappel route instead. We missed the last
rappel (rappel 8 in the topo), and I ended up downclimbing 10 feet in a large
chimney to flat ground, while Gavin downclimbed some dirty 3rd class. It was a
little unnerving following a route that was obviously not in our guidebook, but
fortunately it was a very well established rappel route. We spent the next 45
minutes scrambling back down the gully between higher cathedral and middle
cathedral to the car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.marrama.com/images/IMG_4350.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The chimney I downclimbed. This may have been a first descent - it was covered
in dust and spiderwebs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.marrama.com/images/IMG_4352.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Higher cathedral looking majestic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spent almost 7 hours climbing, about 2 and a half hours on the descent, and
around 30 minutes on the approach, bringing us to a grand total of 10 hours.
While a portion of this time was definitely type 2 fun (especially the
descent), the majority of the excursion was exceedingly enjoyable. This won&amp;rsquo;t
be the last time I go up this route.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;The route in retrospect, taken on the descent. Hover over the picture for what I&amp;rsquo;m fairly
certain is the route we took&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hooligans and Curry</title>
      <link>http://blog.marrama.com/post/hooligans-curry/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 09 Feb 2013 23:05:24 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://blog.marrama.com/post/hooligans-curry/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our first activity of the day was going to the Oxford-Bristol soccer game. We
were warned before that both teams are 5-th or 6th level teams (as opposed to
1st level, like Man. U. or Arsenal, etc) and are therefore shitty, and also
that no one in Oxford besides hardcore local fans really cares about Oxford
football. Despite these warnings, we couldn&amp;rsquo;t be prepared for the magnitude of
the cultural experience we were about to get.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We take the bus there and are
instantly greeted by hundreds of police officers lined up along the trail. I&amp;rsquo;m
used to police presence at sporting events, but have never seen this many for
such a small game. We immediately head to the beer tent outside of the stadium.
The tent contains a couple of counters selling beer and cheap burgers, and the
whole place is packed with fans. Once we grab beers we stand outside of the
main crowd, who begin chanting loudly and in completely unintelligible accents.
According to Connor, they were first chanting about Oxford&amp;rsquo;s and Bristol&amp;rsquo;s
hatred of a mutual rival, and then the Bristol fans switched to chanting about
their own team. It was hilarious listening to a bunch of drunk fans chant
nonsensical things, but eventually the volatile combination of alcohol and
rabid rival soccer fans turned sour (shocking, I know).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 20 minutes from our arrival, a fight breaks out in the middle of the
crowd. The cops quickly run over and break up the fight and surrounding crowd,
which has a few effects. It broke up the main fight, but it also turned the
crowd up a notch in anger and it dispersed everyone else who wanted to fight
all around the parking lot. While this might not have been the ideal outcome,
the cops were absolutely obligated to come in and break up the main mob before
people started to get seriously hurt. Anyways, things start to get a bit more
intense. Once the cops dispersed the main mob, we slowly tried to make our way
to the stadium, but fights kept breaking out all around us. We stood only a few
meters away from some, watching drunk British men seriously try and beat the
crap out of each other with nothing held back. The standout fight happened as
we were trying to edge around a grassy knoll. Two rival groups of about 5
people each saw each other from opposite sides of the knoll and immediately
charged each other. Connor&amp;rsquo;s friend summed it up perfectly when he said it
looked like &amp;ldquo;a shitty version of braveheart&amp;rdquo;. They met each other with drunken
ferocity I&amp;rsquo;d never seen. I still vividly remember one guy knocking another over
onto his knees and then kicking him square in the face. After seeing this
outbreak, we started to walk with a little more purpose towards the stadium.
Fortunately, seating is segregated in the stadium, making it the safest place
to be in a few mile radius.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.marrama.com/images/riot_police_small.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;riot police&#34; /&gt;
&lt;center&gt;The police barricade after the game&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we were warned, the actual game was horrible. The level of soccer was
noticeably lower than any game you&amp;rsquo;d ever see on tv. The first half mostly
consisted of each team booting the ball back and forth, with occasional passing
and moments of real soccer. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t that pretty to watch, but at the very
least the crowd provided great entertainment. Highlights included a drunk old
guy behind us calling a player a &amp;ldquo;fat cunt&amp;rdquo; at the top of his lungs, two
younger teenage fans calling every player &amp;ldquo;shit&amp;rdquo; in a scathing tone with thick
accents, and the constant yelling between the two extremely well barricaded
sections. The other team won by a PK and a sloppy breakaway goal, and we left
before the rival team&amp;rsquo;s fans started to leave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leaving the stadium, there was a row of about 100 police officers barricading
the rival fans from oxford fans, which provided much-needed separation and a
great photo op. We promptly left on the next bus to town and went back to Tom&amp;rsquo;s
house to reflect on the experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After getting a couple drinks in us, we went to curry with the bros and the
lads. &amp;ldquo;Getting curry&amp;rdquo; is a popular activity in Oxford, exclusively because all
of the curry restaurants are BYOB. As you might imagine, this attracts tons of
college students. We got there around 8:30 or so, which was just late enough to
be seated next to 2 loud tables full of drunk college students making speeches
and drinking. We got some curry, did more drinking, and eventually became those
obnoxious college students, making speeches and all. Tom ordered a fancy dish
that came out sizzling, and one of the lads said &amp;ldquo;happy birthday&amp;rdquo; jokingly to
Tom. We thought nothing of it, but after dinner was done a waiter brought out a
complementary birthday cake for Tom, so we had to give fake birthday speeches
about Tomas. I froze up in the middle of mine, Hannah and Jimmy made friendly
and praising speeches, and all of the lads&amp;rsquo; speeches were (predictably) filled
with healthy amounts of sarcasm and insults. Connor went last, and decided it
more appropriate to punch the cake instead of actually making a speech.  After
eating some disfigured cake, we went to a couple more pubs and then headed back
to bed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We started the day moving apartments from our first Berlin AirBnB stay to our
second Berlin AirBnB stay (booked after mass confusion and panic), which was
fortunately only a block down the street. After dropping off our stuff at the
new place, we quickly left for our tour of Sachsenhausen, the closest
concentration camp to Berlin. Our tourguide was a very tall, skinny, and pale
Brit named Rob, who was very quick-witted and clearly experienced at giving
tours. We met up with our group of about 15, took a train for 40 minutes, a bus
for another 5, and then finally began our tour at Sachsenhausen around 12.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much like the tour of Yad Vashem, witnessing the horrors of Sachsenhausen
eventually gave way to an enveloping sense of numbness. One of the first major
topics we covered was the SS and their methods for keeping the camp under
control with only ~300 officers for ~50,000 prisoners. They obviously had
fences, guns, and machine gun turrets surrounding and overlooking the entirety
of the camp, but this wasn&amp;rsquo;t enough. To really control the prisoners, they
employed an ingenious and cruel system of hierarchy and intimidation, primarily
designed to break the prisoners spirits and turn them against each other. When
a group of prisoners arrived to Sachsenhausen, the SS would pick one prisoner
that stood out from the rest and beat him to near death infront of the rest of
the group. The prisoners would then be sorted into a rigid hierarchy, with
criminals occupying the highest position, jews occupying the lowest, and
blacks/roma/other undesirables occupying everything in between. This helped to
turn the prisoners against themselves, further helping prevent an uprising.
Over and over throughout the tour, I found myself involuntarily muttering
expletives. The sheer cruelty and evil that they institutionalized is beyond
description.  Learning about all the gritty details of how they carried out
this evil really drove home how horrible they were. To carry out everything
that SS soldiers did required a special combination of brainwashing (to see
others as subhuman), cruelty, evil, and blind unquestioning obedience to
authority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.marrama.com/images/IMG_3334.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Entering the camp. The monolithic figure in the
center is the Russian memorial&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Jewish prisoners&amp;rsquo; sleeping quarters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The worst part of Sachsenhausen was the area specifically reserved for
mass murdering. They only employed gas chambers and shooting people into pits
on a minor scale. The main method with which they murdered over 10,000 russian
prisoners of war and other undesirables at Sachsenhausen was called the
&amp;ldquo;neckshot&amp;rdquo; method. This was where they had incoming prisoners go into a
&amp;ldquo;medical examination&amp;rdquo; room one at a time, stand behind a height-measuring
device with a slit down the middle, and then the executioner would shoot the
person in the neck from the other side of the slit. This solved a major
problem, which was the psychological toll that having to execute someone
face-to-face was taking on SS officers. Once the prisoner was executed, his
body would then be incinerated. During the war, the only visible sign of
industrial murder outside of the death-building was the copious amount of smoke
produced by constant cremation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We finished up the tour, walked back to the train station, and bid Rob
adieu. After we got back to our new place, we grabbed dinner across the street
at a little cafe recommended by Grace. It didn&amp;rsquo;t disappoint, although we
unfortunately left ourselves a small amount of time to experience &amp;ldquo;the
labyrinth&amp;rdquo;. Recommended by our friend Adrienne, &amp;ldquo;the labyrinth&amp;rdquo; refers to
Salon–Zur wilden Renate, a small bar/club in Berlin that houses a crawling maze
in the back. I insisted on going as our last activity in Berlin - I trusted
Adrienne&amp;rsquo;s wisdom and didn&amp;rsquo;t want to miss out. We rushed on public transit and
got there exactly at 10, which is when they stop accepting people in the maze.
Out of sheer luck, the hostess included us as the last 2 people in the night&amp;rsquo;s
queue of labyrinth-goers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The door lady said it would be two hours before we
could go in, giving us plenty of time for a few drinks. We bought a couple of
cheap and strong mixed drinks and grabbed seats in the little venue-area to
watch this weird electro-punk band that was playing. I was instantly convinced
that this was the weirdest show of my life. The band, Sado Opera, was made up
of a DJ-keyboardist duo in the back, a drummer on an electric drum set, a
skinny lead singer, two backup lady singers, and a dwarf. They warmed up by
playing the two same songs over and over again to check levels and coordinate
the light show. The first song was a catchy song about &amp;lsquo;fire at the disco&amp;rsquo;, or
something like that. The second song was an equally catchy song that is
described well by its line: &amp;lsquo;I dream of love but I make fuck with
every-every-everybody&amp;rsquo;. The chorus consisted of the 2 lady backup singers
yelling &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m so sad - I&amp;rsquo;m so lonely - Just a squirt - Make me squirt&amp;rdquo; in a
hilariously German voice. They also spent a little time coordinating the lights
for a special part of their show. The lead singer instructed the light tech to
flicker the lights when he (the lead singer) did the following actions: yelling
&amp;ldquo;THERE IS HIGH VOLTAGE&amp;rdquo;, writhing around on stage, and pretending to clamp
alligator clips on the (topless) backup singers&amp;rsquo; nipples. Throughout their
warm-up set, Hannah and I were cracking up. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t believe how weirdly
awesome and awesomely weird this band was, and that we were getting to
experience it all! Regrettably, the band was actually playing their real set at
3:30am, and considering we had an 8:45am train to catch, this was a bit out of
the question. On our way out, we got to meet them and they enthusiastically
handed us their card and told us to like them on facebook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Midnight came around quickly (time flies when you&amp;rsquo;re having fun) and
shortly thereafter came our turn for the Labyrinth. Hannah went in first, and
they led me in a few minutes after. The lady put a blindfold over my eyes and
led me by hand into the start of Labyrinth, where she took the blindfold off
and closed the door. The Labyrinth itself was basically a big adult
playstructure with tunnels and enclosed spaces and weird artwork all over the
walls. There was a room with a bunch of monstrous vaginas painted on the wall
whose exit itself was a big vagina, and there was a room/tunnel containing a
bunch of interesting artwork made out of old metal car parts and stuff. I was
running through like a kid in a candy shop, trying to take it all in and
capture the most exciting parts on my phone&amp;rsquo;s camera. I had a bit of a buzz
before entering, but I was riding a purely natural high of excitement all
throughout the maze. It was the best thing I could&amp;rsquo;ve hoped for to end our trip
to Berlin.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Masada and the Dead Sea</title>
      <link>http://blog.marrama.com/post/masada_dead_sea/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This day began bright and early at 7, when our guide Hillel picked us up from
our AirBnB outhouse in Jerusalem. We promptly set out for Masada, an ancient
ruin overlooking the Dead sea that was once held by Jews and conquered by the
Romans in 73 or 74 AD. Before we got there, we made brief stops at the sea
level marker (the dead sea is 423 meters below sea level) and a little gas
station market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we got there we bought tickets and prepared for our walk up the
front of the mountain that Masada resides upon. We took the &amp;ldquo;snake&amp;rdquo; path up the
mountain, which derives its name from its numerous switchbacks. I decided to
get some exercise by power walking up the path, and in the process took off my
shirt and sweat a lot. Right after I got to the top, a tram-load of old
tourists happened to come up at the same time, all of whom took great delight
in laughing at me, calling me &amp;lsquo;Americano&amp;rsquo;, and taking pictures. I was too tired
and hot to do anything but laugh back at them; it was probably a hilarious
scene to have observed. After waiting for Hillel and Hannah to make their way
up, we began a thorough tour of the ruins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.marrama.com/images/IMG_2861.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;Masada&#34; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Looking up the front of Masada. You can barely
see the snake path winding up towards the tram station&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Canyon to the south of Masada. Everything
surrounding Masada looks like this&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the more salient points that Hillel made was that the beauty of
Masada lays in the life that its Jewish inhabitants maintained before their
end, not in their tragic end itself. The compacted story of Masada is that it
was made into a fortified hideout by the paranoid roman king Herod, captured by
Jewish rebels in 66 AD, and then largely destroyed by a roman siege around 73
AD. When the Jewish rebels realized their eventual defeat upon running out of
ammunition, they decided to commit mass suicide instead of submit to capture
and enslavement by the Romans. While the story of Masada is very powerful, I
tend to agree with Hillel. Life in ancient Masada was surprisingly rich and
comfortable, for living in the middle of a desert 2,000 years ago. The
facilities built straight into the mountain for bathing, food storage, defense,
and most impressively water collection were absolutely fascinating and
ingenious. Its hard to believe that the Romans were able to create a fully
functional city housing thousands of soldiers on top of a mountain in a desert.
Solely utilizing technology from over 2,000 years ago, Masada&amp;rsquo;s inhabitants
could store years worth of food, have a steady stream of water, and even have
the luxury of hot baths. Also, the Jewish rebels converted the roman horse
stables into a synagogue. To honor the spirit of Masada, the synagogue is still
used. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how much its actually used or what its used for (its quite
small), but when we visited it we saw a rabbi inside making copies of the
torah. Masada was definitely a high point of the day.&lt;/p&gt;

water comes from the bright cave in the top of the frame and disperses into steam beneath
the floor supported by small pillars&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

flowed in through the small aqueducts on the side of the mountain, and then was
carried up a path to Masada by donkeys.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;A rabbi inside the old synagogue copying a torah.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our next stop was Ein Gedi, which is a little area north of Masada that
has pretty vegetation and a stream running through it. Like Masada, Ein Gedi is
surrounded by barren desert. We went for a short walk up the stream and I swam
around in a cold pool around the base of a small waterfall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.marrama.com/images/GOPR0255.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;Masada&#34; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Walking around in Ein Gedi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.marrama.com/images/GOPR0263.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;Masada&#34; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Ein Gedi was a welcome oasis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then moved onto the dead sea. It seems obligatory that when one goes to
Masada one also goes to float in the Dead sea. They are right next to each
other, and if you buy enough Aveda skin care products at the base of Masada you
are granted free entrance to a little spa and resort. We did as the tourists
do, taking the opportunity to buy gifts for our parents. The resort was packed
with exclusively birthright attendees, most of which were probably of the age
group 18-22. Hillel also leads birthright trips, and shared with us earlier
that he isn&amp;rsquo;t too fond of that age group (apparently most American 18-year-olds
want to drink more than learn about Israel, go figure). We followed along with
the hordes of birthrighters and floated in the dead sea, doused ourselves in
mud, floated again, and changed and left. It was very touristy and crowded and
weird being with young birthrighters, but it was something we were obligated to
do.  Also, actually being in the dead sea was surreal. It has around a 33% salt
content, which makes you unexpectedly buoyant. I felt like a wine cork bobbing
around in normal water; it would&amp;rsquo;ve been hard to submerge your entire body
(although you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t want to, because the salty water burns your eyes).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Floating in the dead sea&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around 3 in the afternoon, we started to make our way back towards Jerusalem.
We stopped at the Jordan river in hopes of witnessing baptisms (people believe
Jesus was baptized there), but we just missed a tour bus full of
freshly-baptized Christians. We also briefly stopped at a Bedouin outpost along
the side of the highway and took pictures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Pitstop at an old bedouin outpost. The stone hut
is likely a couple thousand years old.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got back to Jerusalem and then had to bid Hillel farewell. Hillel was
by far the best person I could&amp;rsquo;ve imagined to introduce me to Israel. He was
instantly our friend, and we got the opportunity to discuss so much more than
just history and key points about sites of interest. I can&amp;rsquo;t even begin to
describe how fantastic of a guide Hillel was, nor even enumerate the qualities
that made him so good. After saying our goodbyes, we headed out to a little
restaurant that Hillel recommended and I nearly fell asleep while eating.
Utterly exhausted, we caught a cab home and passed out immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
